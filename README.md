Creating a smart inventory management system that uses data analytics involves several components, including data collection, analysis, and decision-making for restocking or discounting items. Below is a simple example of what such a system might look like in Python. This system will use a basic demand forecasting model and make stock recommendations accordingly. In a real-world application, you would likely integrate more sophisticated models and possibly even machine learning.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Sample inventory data to mimic database input
inventory_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'product_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'product_name': ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Carrot', 'Doughnut', 'Egg'],
    'stock_level': [50, 20, 100, 10, 5],
    'restock_threshold': [20, 10, 80, 5, 5],
    'daily_sales_avg': [5, 3, 20, 5, 2]
})

# Set up a logging mechanism to track errors and operations
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Basic function to predict restocking needs
def predict_stock_needs(inventory_df):
    try:
        future_date = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=7)
        logging.info(f"Calculating stock predictions for date: {future_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}")
        
        # Calculate future stock level based on average daily sales
        inventory_df['predicted_usage'] = inventory_df['daily_sales_avg'] * 7
        inventory_df['predicted_stock_level'] = inventory_df['stock_level'] - inventory_df['predicted_usage']
        
        # Identify products requiring restock
        inventory_df['need_restock'] = inventory_df['predicted_stock_level'] < inventory_df['restock_threshold']

        return inventory_df[['product_id', 'product_name', 'stock_level', 'predicted_stock_level', 'need_restock']]
    
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error in stock prediction: {e}")
        return None

# Basic function to suggest discounts on overstocked items
def suggest_discounts(inventory_df):
    try:
        # For simplicity, assume if stock level is over 125% of predicition, we suggest discounts
        inventory_df['is_overstocked'] = inventory_df['stock_level'] > (inventory_df['predicted_usage'] * 1.25)
        
        return inventory_df[['product_id', 'product_name', 'stock_level', 'predicted_usage', 'is_overstocked']]
    
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error in suggesting discounts: {e}")
        return None

# Run the prediction and store the results
predicted_inventory = predict_stock_needs(inventory_data)

if predicted_inventory is not None:
    logging.info("Predicted Inventory Needs:")
    print(predicted_inventory)

# Run discount suggestion process and store the results
discount_suggestions = suggest_discounts(inventory_data)

if discount_suggestions is not None:
    logging.info("Discount Suggestions:")
    print(discount_suggestions)
```

### Key Components
1. **Data Structure**: In this simple example, we use a `pandas.DataFrame` to hold mock inventory data.
2. **Prediction Function**: `predict_stock_needs()` forecasts stock needs based on current stock levels and average daily sales.
3. **Discount Suggestion Function**: `suggest_discounts()` identifies overstocked items for potential discounts.
4. **Error Handling**: The program logs errors using Pythonâ€™s `logging` module to help debug issues that occur during operations.
5. **Logging**: Keeps track of operations and errors using the `logging` module.

This program is a basic starting point. In a real-world scenario, one would need to incorporate database connections, more sophisticated demand forecasting algorithms (possibly using machine learning), integration with point-of-sale and warehouse management systems, and potentially a user interface.
